What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Sorted Array?

A sorted array is a data structure where elements are stored in a specific, predetermined sequence, usually in ascending or descending order.

This ordering provides various benefits, such as optimized search operations, at the cost of more complex insertions and deletions.

Advantages
-----------

Efficient Searches: Sorted arrays are optimized for search operations, especially when using algorithms like Binary Search, which has a O(log n) time complexity.

Additional Query Types: They support other specialized queries, like bisection to find the closest element and range queries to identify elements within a specified range.

Cache Efficiency: The contiguous memory layout improves cache utilization, which can lead to faster performance.

Disadvantages
------------------

Slow Updates: Insertions and deletions generally require shifting elements, leading to O(n) time complexity for these operations.

Memory Overhead: The need to maintain the sorted structure can require extra memory, especially during updates.

Lack of Flexibility: Sorted arrays are less flexible for dynamic resizing and can be problematic in parallel computing environments.


Time Complexity
---------------

Access: O(1).
Search: O(1) for exact matches, O(log n) with binary search for others.
Insertion: O(1) for the end, but usually O(n) to maintain the order.
Deletion: O(1) for the end, but usually O(n) to maintain the order.
Append: O(1) if appending a larger value, but can spike to O(n) if resizing or inserting in order.
