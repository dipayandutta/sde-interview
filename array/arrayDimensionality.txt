Array Dimernsionality indicates the number of indices required to select an element with the array. A classic example is the Tic-Tac-Toe board, which is the two dimension array.

Example
--------
# Setting up the Tic-Tac-Toe board
tic_tac_toe_board = [
    ['X', 'O', 'X'],
    ['O', 'X', 'O'],
    ['X', 'O', 'X']
]

# Accessing the top-left corner (which contains 'X'):
element = tic_tac_toe_board[0][0]
