Advantages
-----------
[*]Speed: Arrays provide O(1) access and append operations when appending at a known index (like the end).

[*] Cache Performance: Arrays, with their contiguous memory layout, are efficient for tasks involving sequential data access

Disadvantages:
--------------

Size Limitation:- Arrays have a fixed size after allocation. Resizing means creating a new array, leading to potential memory overhead or data transfer costs.

Mid-Array Changes: Operations like insertions or deletions are O(n)
 due to necessary element shifting
