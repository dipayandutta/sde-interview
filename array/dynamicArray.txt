What is a Dynamic Array?
-------------------------
Dynamic arrays start with a preset capacity and automatically resize as needed. When full, they allocate a larger memory block—often doubling in size—and copy existing elements.

Key Features
-------------
Adaptive Sizing: Dynamic arrays adjust their size based on the number of elements, unlike fixed-size arrays.
Contiguous Memory: Dynamic arrays, like basic arrays, keep elements in adjacent memory locations for efficient indexed access.
Amortized Appending: Append operations are typically constant time. However, occasional resizing might take longer, but averaged over multiple operations, it’s still
O(1).
