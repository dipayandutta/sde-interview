The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex inside CPython that ensures:
Only one thread executes Python bytecode at any given time per process
Even on a multi-core Linux system.
-----------
Important:
-----------
The Linux kernel does NOT know about the GIL
Linux schedules threads normally
Python blocks execution internally


Why GIL exists
---------------
Reasons:
 Memory management simplicity
 Reference counting safety
 Single-threaded performance

Removing GIL would require:

Fine-grained locks
Slower single-thread performance
Massive interpreter rewrite


The GIL is entirely on the user space
