Sliding Window
===============

A sliding windows is a technique used to process a contiguous subarray/substring by moving a window over data instead of recomputing from scratch.

Brute Force Solutions
O(n^2) or O(n^3)

Sliding window reduces this to 
O(n)

[*] Sliding window reduces 
			- Reusing previous computation
			- Adding one element
			- Removing One element


[*] When to use sliding Window
	
		- Input is array/string
		- You nedd a subarray/substring
		- Condition involves
				-	sum
				- count
				- max/min
				- uniqueness
		-	Data is Contigous


[*] Two types of Sliding Window

1. Fixed Window
		-	Window size is constant
			Example:	"Max sum of subarray of size k"

2. Variable Window
		- Window Size Changes Dynamically
			Example : "Longest substring without repeating characters"
