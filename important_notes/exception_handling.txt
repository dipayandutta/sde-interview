try:
    # Part which might cause an error
except TypeError:
    # What happens when error occurs | In this case what happens what a TypeError occurs
else:
    # what happens if there is no exception | Optional
finally:
    # Executed after try and except| always executed | Optional

This there a sequence in defining exception in except block for exception handling?

Yes .

try:
    pass
except (TypeError, IndexError, RuntimeError) as error:
    pass
